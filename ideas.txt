Calculate heuristic to win, and chance to get second place from any position



Try all commands for 3 steps, assume equal chance of each command from opponents in weighting
, to see which would be best positioned to win differeing races



trait GameState {
	create_from_input()
	
	
	heuristic_to_win() -> (f32,f32)
	
	advance(player_command, opp_1_command, opp_2_command)
}
